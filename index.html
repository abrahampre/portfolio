                <h3> My Early Life </h3>
                <p>From early age i was a hands on kind of person. Always building something with cardboard, wood, junk pieces of metal from my grandparents backyard.
                    I enjoyed the outdoors, playing with my neigborhood friends in the small town in Mexico where i was born Ciudad Victoria. After having my first LEGO toy,
                    I decided to just have those kind of toys for chirstmas. My mom always said "He will be an engineer", She was wrong I became an Mechanical engineer and
                    now im pursuing my dream of becoming a Software Developer
